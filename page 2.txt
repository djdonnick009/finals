The final poem I write for you
Before I move on...
I'm telling everything
Even though you've gone.

We started out as best friends,
Or at least "best friends" in my eyes.
Maybe there was NEVER anything
And it was all just lies.

I met you, I liked you,
And I waited for years.
You were reasons for laughing
And for tears.

It was all because you smiled at me;
In 2004: that first day.
Over the years,
The crush seemed to stay.

It seemed to build,
As the year ran on, I seemed to fall.
As each day progressed,
You became my all.

8 years it grew,
Without a hint to say you didn't like me back.
You didn't show,
That I had a reason to crack.

Then you pushed,
And you found what was true.
I had your hopeful words,
"I like you too."

6 months together,
But it felt like so much more.
I thought I finally had a reason;
Something worth living for.

I tried to change you though,
When all you wanted was an ear.
That's when you started going cold,
And I had something to fear.

Then through the grape vine,
I heard I was your "friend"
That you never really wanted me,
And you wanted to end.

I ignored it,
Thought it was a lie.
And yet he started getting drunk,
And when he was sober I would cry.

Slowly it got worse,
the rumours dawned as true.
Truth was, the first lie you told me
Was "I like you too."

You never really cared
I was never more than a friend.
When you admitted you didn't care to hurt me,
I made it our end.

And then for four months I waited
Hoping you'd change your mind
I looked at every other guy
As a distraction to find.

And now it's a new year,
Now I finally move on.
This is my final poem to you,
Now I'm gone.
